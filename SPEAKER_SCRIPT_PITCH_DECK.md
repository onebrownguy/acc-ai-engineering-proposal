## 💬 Q&A Preparation

### Budget Questions
> "We modeled this on ACC's Adobe and Office 365 access programs. Just as ACC subsidizes creative software for design students, we're proposing AI development tools. The $48K-80K covers 30-50 students with professional-grade APIs — about $1,000-1,600 per student for a full year of learning."

### Sustainability Questions
> "Student Life registration means this survives graduation. We'll establish officer succession, document processes, and recruit across class years. Leadership rotates but the organization persists — just like ACC's existing student organizations."

### Why Students Not Faculty?
> "We're not replacing faculty leadership — we're partnering with it. Students bring authentic demand signals, peer learning credibility, and the energy to activate existing resources like Austin AI Alliance in ways that pure faculty initiatives can't."

### Equity Concerns
> "All majors welcome, not just CS students. Free workshops remove financial barriers. Multi-campus events ensure access. Peer-led model means students teach students in accessible language, not intimidating jargon."

### Tool Access Concerns
> "We're proposing the same model ACC uses for Adobe Creative Cloud and Office 365 — institutional licenses that give students professional tools for learning. This isn't luxury access — it's workforce preparation for a $70K-90K entry-level job market."
