Overview
Austin Community College (ACC) recognizes experiential learning as an integral part of a student’s learning experiences and overall education. Our Experiential Learning Programs strive to provide real-world, hands-on opportunities that help students build upon and enhance previously learned coursework in their area of study.

While experiential learning can include in-classroom activities, external learning experiences are unique out-of-classroom experiences that are linked directly to job skills development in workplace environments.

ACC offers a variety of experiential learning classes for students in all Areas of Study including internships, practicum, and cooperative education (co-ops) courses, Health Science clinical and practicum experiences, apprenticeships, and service-learning.

Apprenticeships
Austin Community College (ACC) now offers two types of Apprenticeship programs: Registered Apprenticeships (RAP) recognized by the Department of Labor, and Industry Standard ACC Recognized Apprenticeships (IRAP). An apprenticeship is a structured system of job training designed to prepare individuals for occupations in skilled trades. It combines on-the-job industry skills standards with job-related classroom instruction. Apprenticeships are organized and managed in cooperation between educational institutions and employers. They are always paid positions associated with a curriculum, and are designed as a means for students to put theory into practice and master knowledge in a way that empowers them with professional autonomy. Apprenticeship programs are typically not course designations, but rather a sequence of courses organized into a degree or certificate plan.
Austin Community College’s (ACC) Apprenticeships are available in Accounting, Computer Science, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Supply Chain and Logistics, and Veterinary.

Visit Apprenticeships for more information.

Co-ops
Academic Co-ops
Academic Co-ops are not regulated by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB). These classes are centered on experiential learning activities within the classroom or college campuses. Examples include case studies, entrepreneurial activities, and research-based classes.

Workforce Co-ops
Workforce co-ops are another form of experiential learning defined by the THECB. Workforce co-ops are identical to practicums, but have an added requirement of weekly lectures.

Visit Office of Experiential Learning for more information.

Internships
Internships are structured, supervised, and evaluated educational experiences that allow students to apply academic knowledge in a professional setting. These experiences help students explore career interests, develop new skills, and gain firsthand exposure to the workplace in their field of study.

To earn academic credit, students must be enrolled in an Internship, Cooperative Education (Co-op), or Practicum course while completing their internship. These are regulated by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) and have specific requirements regarding the minimum number of work hours and the relevance of the job experience to the student’s academic program.

Internships are designed to benefit both students and employers, and positions may be paid or unpaid. Students gain real-world experience in roles aligned with their academic major and career goals, while employers benefit from their skills and assistance. Employers recruit students to work on special projects, assist with daily tasks, or provide support during times of higher demand.

What sets internships apart from short-term jobs is the intentional “learning agenda” embedded within each experience. Students have defined learning objectives, and supervisors serve as mentors, offering guidance and opportunities to support professional growth.

Austin Community College (ACC) advises students to begin their internship search early, as employers often recruit 3-6 months in advance of the upcoming semester.

Visit Internships for more information.

Practicums & Clinicals
Practicums
Practicums are similar to internships, but are less closely supervised and are suitable for students preparing for career entry. They provide workplace settings in which students gain practical experience in a discipline, enhance skills, and integrate knowledge. Practicum classes are regulated by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB). Practicum experiences typically have a larger contact hour requirement than internships and may or may not be paid.

Health Science Practicums – see below

Clinicals
Clinical experience is a key component in some programs. Students apply theory learned in the classroom to practice in several clinical settings for “hands-on” experience.

Settings for these experiences vary, offering students the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills in areas involving many populations across the lifespan at medical and/or educational facilities.

Health Science Practicums
Health Science Practicums are similar to clinicals, but have a larger contact hour requirement.
