## 🐛 Known Issues / Risks

### Potential Risks:

2. **Browser Compatibility** - Older browsers may not support all features
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement (degrades gracefully)
3. **Projector Display** - Unknown resolution/aspect ratio
   - Mitigation: Test Thursday on actual equipment
4. **JavaScript Disabled** - Some users may have JS off
   - Mitigation: All content accessible without JS

### Fallback Plan:
If any feature breaks on Friday:
- **Option 1:** Use parent directory original version
- **Option 2:** Disable problematic feature (comment out JS)
- **Option 3:** PDF backup (static version)
